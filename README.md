# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Our client, Steve, wanted to use the worksheet previously created to be able to run the same analysis on other stocks. The goal was to refactor the code to make it cleaner and for it to run faster; while the original code may word for a handful of stocks, if he should decide to analyze hundreds, or even thousands of stocks the code as originally written might not be adequate.

## Analysis and Challenges

## Results



## Summary

Refactoring code has many advantages, it gives you another look at the code to see if any of it is repetitive, if any variables could be used to decrease said repetition, which ultimaely works to improve the time it takes the code to run. Refactoring is a lot like proofreading your code with fresh eyes to see what can be made better and what could be dropped completely. On the other hand, refactoring can cause more errors and hours of corrections if not done carefully; it's a good idea to work from a copy of the code that was originally built.

One main disadvantage of the refactored script is that it's still built for the original 12 stocks, it may get slower and slower as more tickers are added. There could be a solution that automates which tickers are used, and may improve elapsed time when analyzing hundreds or thousands of stocks.
